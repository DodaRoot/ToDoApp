# My version of a Todoapp
ToDoApp is made with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I wanted to test my skills with storing and relocating data, calculating time, and saving information.
# If you do not want to create a account
You can use one of these accounts to login if you do not want to sign up, although the account information is stored only in your browser.
1. Username - John / Password - 12345
2. Username - Doda / Password - 12345
# How to use the Todoapp
When you first login, you are prompted with a navbar in which you can change your profile img to youre preference if you click in the profile pic, you will also see the option to create a new list in the main section each list can have
different or the same names, and each list can have multiple tasks or items. After you click on add an item, you will be asked to put in a name and date, and the program will calculate how much time you have left to complete the task if you do not.
complete the task in time, the task will time out, letting you know that you can still complete that task if you want.
